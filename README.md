# JavaScript: Password Generator

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

Tha main page contains textarea which shows the generated password and a red clickable button for generating password.

Once the button is clicked, a criteria form will show up which includes password length and character sets that the user would like to include.The user is asked to fill out the form accordingly. Once the user click Submit, all the inputs will be validated: is password length an integer and between 8 and 128? Is one of the character sets selected? If one of the following validation fails, the user will be prompted to correct the inputs. 

After validation, the criteria form will disappear and the textarea with a password of desired criteria will show up again.
